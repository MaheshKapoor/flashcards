                  <p>The world is a global family. People are spreading across
                  the world with the help of fast modes of transportation.
                  Transportation industry is evolving to meet the world's
                  changing demands. We have already made so much progress after
                  inventing the wheel in the stone age. Not sure what's there in the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>Basically, we have three mode of transportation i.e. Surface, Water and Air.
                  <a href="/transportation-flashcard">Transportation flashcard</a>
                  covers all three modes of transportation.
                  </p>
                  <ol><li>
                    <strong>Surface:</strong> Land based movement of the human, products and services
                    is known as Surface transportation. This mode of transportation is used for
                    short or medium distance places. The example of surface based transportation
                    covered in the flashcards are: Train, Car, Truck, Motorbike, Bicycle.
                  </li><li>
                    <strong>Air:</strong> Air based movement of human products and services
                    is known as Air transportation. This mode is used for long distances or
                    fast movement like from one country to another country etc. Air transportation
                    is comparatively costly in all. The example of air based transportation covered
                    in the flashcards are: Aeroplane, helicopter, glider etc.
                  </li><li>
                    <strong>Water:</strong>  Water based movement of human, products and services
                    is known as Water transportation. This more is used only for sea routes, it's
                    comparatively cheaper but takes more time. This mode of transportation is
                    primarily used to transfer goods. The example of water based transportation
                    covered in the flashcard are: Ship, yacht etc

                  <br/>
                  <p>Transportation of goods is done via all above modes of transportation
                  like truck, train, ship and aeroplane. We transport

                  <p>Tourism industry is expanding with the new travelling facilities.
                  Tourists are planning vacations in far world places to experience
                  the new culture and food. We have covered almost all world famous
                  places in <a href="/flashcard/AGE4WORLDPLACESFLASHCARD">world places flashcards</a>.
                  </p>
                  <p>Humans are not only exploring far distant places on earth but also
                  in space. We are exploring life on different planets. Recently, we
                  have sent a few rockets to the planet Mars. Space organisations have
                  established a space station up in space for astronauts to monitor the
                  universe closely. We have covered space vocabulary in
                  <a href="/flashcard/science-spaceandrocket-flashcard">space and rocket flashcard</a>.

                  <h3>How to use this flashcard?</h3>
                  <p>Parents should show the transportation flashcard to the child and make the
                  sound in front of them. We should encourage kids to mimic the sound and recognize the transportation.
                  </p>
                <p>Parents should let child recognize the transportation before telling them. Sometime, they may recognize
                incorrectly but with regular practise they will improve. <br/>
                </p>
                  <p>Continuous practise of the flashcard may help to develop speech or improve speech in children.</p>
