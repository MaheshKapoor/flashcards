            We created this version recently for our own kid,
            who was facing speech delay during COVID-19 pandemic.
            Kids weren’t socializing much during lockdown which affected
            their natural process of speech development. We created these
            flashcards to help our kid to know things around us.

            “Omishaan.com” is a product for all parents who are facing any type of speech
            disorder in their kids. Regular practice of these flashcards help to overcome some speech delays.
            We are working on the problems faced by us personally and bring a solution for the
            masses. We don’t charge anything from any parents. It's free to use by anyone.
